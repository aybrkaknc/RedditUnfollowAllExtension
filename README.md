# Reddit Unfollow All Extension

An extension I developed for the spring cleaning I occasionally do on Reddit. It helps you bulk unfollow subreddits while keeping the ones you want.

## Features

- **Whitelist System:** Select specific subreddits to keep (e.g., r/Turkey, r/programming) and unfollow the rest.
- **Old & New Reddit Support:** Works on both the modern interface and `old.reddit.com`.
- **Search & Filter:** Easily find subreddits in the list before starting the process.
- **Language Support:** simple TR/EN toggle.

## Installation

Since this is a personal tool and not on the Chrome Web Store yet:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder of this project.
5. Go to your Reddit subscription page (e.g., `reddit.com/subreddits` or sidebar) and you'll see the panel.

## Usage

1. **Review List:** Click the button to see all your subscriptions.
2. **Select to Keep:** Check the boxes for subreddits you want to stay subscribed to.
3. **Start:** Hit start and let it run. It will skip the ones you selected.
